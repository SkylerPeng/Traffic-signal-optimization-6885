# Traffic-signal-optimization-6885

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for a reinforcement learning–based traffic signal control project using the CityFlow simulator.

## Project Structure
`single_intersection/`: Single-intersection traffic signal control experiments using DQN and PPO.
`multi_intersection/`: Multi-intersection traffic signal control with shared DQN parameters.
`Environment setting/`: Environment configuration files.
`README.md`: Project overview.

## Methods
We model traffic signal control as a Markov Decision Process and apply Deep Reinforcement Learning methods, including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  
Experiments are conducted under both single-intersection and multi-intersection settings.
